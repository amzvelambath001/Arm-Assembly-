.global makes the _start label visible to the linker, so the OS knows where to start running the program.
_start is the program’s entry point — the first instruction the OS executes when the program runs.
r7 is the register for syscall numbers in ARM Linux.
4 is the syscall number for write()  - like hey i want to write some data
For write, the arguments are:
r0 → File descriptor (1 for stdout)
r1 → Address of the data (like a string)
r2 → Number of bytes to write

We set r0 to 1 because that tells the write syscall to send the output to stdout, which is usually your terminal screen.
ldr r1, =hello loads the memory address of the string into r1
13 is the length of the string "hello world!\n"
svc 0 (supervisor call) tells the Linux kernel to execute the syscall.
.ascii stores the text in memory without a null terminator.
